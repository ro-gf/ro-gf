Hello, my name is Rodrigo Gonzalez.
I'm an undergraduate in the area of biological sciences.
I am just getting started in the world of coding.
If you could offer any useful tips or resources for someone who doesn't have a lot of experience with programming, I would very much appreciate it.
Have a nice day.
